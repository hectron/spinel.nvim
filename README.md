# spinel.nvim

A Neovim port of [Shopify's Spinel VSCode Theme](https://github.com/Shopify/vscode-shopify-ruby/tree/7a45e847f30f26380c09a8e48f5256ae9eff6a1e/themes).

## Development

If you're using Lazy, you can set up a `.lazy.lua` to point to a local instance of spinel:

```lua
return {
  {
    "hectron/spinel.nvim",
    dir = ".",
  },
}
```
```
```
